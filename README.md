# Glances Docker Compose

This is a simple docker-compose file to run Glances in a docker container. Special thanks to [@nicolargo](https://github.com/nicolargo) for the original [Glances](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances) project.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dotyigit/glances-docker-compose.git
```

Go to the directory:

```bash
cd glances-docker-compose
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
